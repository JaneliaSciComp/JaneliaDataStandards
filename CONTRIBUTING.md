# How to contribute

Thanks for considering contributing to Janelia's data standards!

In order to keep things simple, please refrain from forking this repository.
Instead, create a new branch with your changes in this repository and create a pull request against the main branch (or any other suitable branch).
If you don't have edit rights in this repository but would like them, please contact Virginia Scarlett.

Posts in a format suitable for [quarto](https://quarto.org), such as quarto markdown (.qmd) or a notebook (.ipynb) can be added to /posts/. Use the existing posts as a template, at least for the 'front matter' (configuration block). To see how the website will look as you're working, do `quarto preview`. When you're finished making changes, render the site with `quarto preview` or `quarto render`. (The latter will render the site pages without opening a browser tab.) Then commit and push as you normally would.
