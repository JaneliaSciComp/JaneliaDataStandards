# How to contribute

Thanks for considering to contribute to Janelia's data standards!
If you use any data format at Janelia that you think could benefit from (internal) standardization, feel free to add your format to this repository.

In order to keep things simple, please refrain from forking this repository.
Instead, create a new branch with your changes in this repository and create a pull request against the main branch (or any other suitable branch).
If you don't have edit rights in this repository, please contact Virginia Scarlett.
Everybody who wants to contribute will be given write access.

## Formalities

Please add a folder with the name of your data format to the root of the file tree.
This folder should at least contain:
* A short `README.md` detailing where and how this data format is used.
* Files `data_standards.md` and `metadata_standards.md` that formally describe the data format (e.g., in the form of a JSON schema).
