# Welcome to Janelia Data Standards

The Janelia Data Standards Hub is a pilot project to centralize Janelia's bioimaging schemas, standards, and data formats. This project is at a very preliminary stage.

## Goals

Here are the long-term goals for the Data Standards Hub:

* Achieve full interoperability between bioimaging data formats at Janelia.
* Develop an elegant bioimaging data model that both microscopists and developers can understand, so that they can make choices together using a common language.
* Develop an attractive website hosting versioned, living documentation for all image formats used at Janelia, educational resources explaining image data conventions, and tutorials for working with Janelia’s flagship tools and data sets.
* Provide documentation and schematization services for Janelians developing new data formats.
    * Also provide composable, swappable subschemas for common data and metadata structures.
* Maintain (JSON schema-oriented) file format translation, conversion and validation tools. Examples include:
    * Libraries in several programming languages for reading and writing chunked image data.
    * Libraries for translating metadata into an abstract, format-independent namespace.
    * A web-based GUI that validates and describes whatever data set it’s pointed to.
* As much as possible, work with the global bioimaging community to develop image processing standards and conventions.
