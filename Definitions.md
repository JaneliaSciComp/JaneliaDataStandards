# Definitions

### "array" 
(1) An n-dimensional collection of discrete samples whose domain is a regular grid.
(2) A node in a hierarchy that contains a data structure of the type described in (1). Array nodes cannot have child nodes.

### "aliasing"

### "downsampling"
The act of resampling an image to a lower resolution, often by an integer factor.

### "field of view"
The physical extent of the domain of an image.

### "filtering"

### "group"
A node in a hierarchy that can have child nodes, and cannot contain data.

### "hierarchy"
A collection of groups and arrays, connected in a tree-like structure.

### "image"
an array whose samples are interpreted as measurements over a physical space, with a particular sampling rate, or "resolution".

### "interpolation"

### "pixel" 
A single sample of a two-dimensional image.

Often used interchangeably with "sample".

Related terms: "sample", "voxel"

### "resampling"
the process of generating a new array that represents an image at a new resolution. 

The new resolution is often an integer multiple of the original image resolution, but need not be. Resampling
methods often consist of filtering and interpolation steps.

Related terms: "downsampling", "resolution"

### "resolution"
the physical (often spatial) sampling rate of an image. 

A high resolution image will comprise of more samples for the same field of view compared to a low resolution image.

Related terms: "spacing", "pixel spacing", "pixel resolution"

### "sample" 

### "voxel" 
A single sample of a three-dimensional image.
